# Creature Feature for 1GAM
Side scrolling, maybe multiplayer. I wanted to do a Defender style
wrap around, but ... maybe not?

I think I might make it 8x8 with massive jumps. Lots of undead attacking you from everywhere. Something like that!? I was going to make it 16x16 but the sprites are ridiculously too big. 8x8 is probably my limit artistically.
